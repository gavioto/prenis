Download this example NSI file: [Mobux.nsi](http://www.pixolut.com/prenis/examples.zip) to see how easy it is to use PreNIS in your project.

We use PreNIS as an integral step in the build pipelines we create using [nAnt](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nant/).

It means that the entire project is managed from the Visual Studio IDE without the need to modify external files.
